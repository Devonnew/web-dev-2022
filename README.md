## Setup

This repository uses `git subtree` to pull from remote repositories into a centralized origin. ~~To pull latest changes, simply run the `pull-repos` script.~~ Simply `git pull` to get the latest update. The script is more for internal uses to keep up to sync with the children repositories (but feel free to dig around).

```bash
# Give execute permission
chmod +x ./pull-repos

# Run the command
./pull-repos
```

## Usage

We will be doing live demos and pushing changes from our respective workshop and remote repository. As such, it is recommended to sandbox your own modification and exploration in a separate branch to keep the merge strategy straightforward. For instance, if you want to follow along with the `react-hooks` demo, make a branch first. At the end of the workshop, switch to `main`, and run `pull-repos`.
